    "Simulate the random-dot discrimination experiment. Denote the stimulus by plus or minus, corresponding to the two directions of motion. On each trial, choose the stimulus randomly with equal probability for the two cases. When the minus stimulus is chosen, generate the responses of the neuron as 20 Hz plus a random Gaussian term with a standard deviation of 10 Hz (set any rates that come out negative to zero). When the plus stimulus is chosen, generate the responses as $20 + 10d$ Hz plus a random Gaussian term with a standard deviation of 10 Hz, where $d$ is the discriminability (again, set any rates that come out negative to zero). First, choose a threshold $z = 20 + 5d$, which is half-way between the means of the two response distributions. Whenever $r \\ge z$ guess \"plus\", otherwise guess \"minus\". Over a large number of trials (1000, for example) determine how often you get the right answer for different $d$ values. Plot the percent correct as a function of d over the range $0 \\le d \\le 10$. Next, by allowing $z$ to vary over a range, plot ROC curves for several values of $d$ (starting with $d = 2$). To do this, determine how frequently the guess is \"plus\" when the stimulus is, in fact, plus (this is $\\beta$), and how often the guess is \"plus\" when the real stimulus is minus (this is $\\alpha$). Then, plot $\\beta$ versus $\\alpha$ for $z$ over the range $0 \\le z \\le 140$."
