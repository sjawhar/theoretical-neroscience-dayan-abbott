In the file, `counts` is a vector containing the number of spikes in each 15.6 ms bin, and `stim` contains the 32767, 16 × 16 images that were presented at the corresponding times. Specifically, `stim(x, y, t)` is the stimulus presented at the coordinate `(x,y)` at time-step `t`. Note that `stim` is an `int8` array that must to be converted into `double` using the command `stim=double(stim)` in order to be manipulated within Matlab. Calculate the spike-triggered average images for each of the 12 time steps before each spike and show them all (using the `imagesc` command). Note that in this example, the time bins can contain more than one spike, so the spike-triggered average must be computed by weighting each stimulus by the number of spikes in the corresponding time bin, rather than weighting it by either 1 or 0 depending on whether a spike is present or not. In the averaged images, you should see a central receptive field that reverses sign over time. By summing up the images across one spatial dimension, produce a figure like that of figure 2.25C."
