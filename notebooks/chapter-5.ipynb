For these simulations, set the initial membrane voltages of the two neurons to slightly different values, randomly, and run the simulation until an equilibrium situation has been reached, which may take a few seconds of simulated run time. Start from a few different random initial conditions to study whether the results are consistent. Investigate what happens if you change the strengths and time constants of the reciprocal synapses."
